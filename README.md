# crypto-price-and-search-history-api
An API with two serverless microservices on AWS: one for querying the current price of a cryptocurrency and sending the result via email, and another for retrieving the search history of previous cryptocurrency queries. Built using Node.js, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and SES, this solution is fully serverless and designed for scalability and simplicity.
